# linux text editor config files

I setup a lot of systems for work, and have to keep adding config files in the three text editors I use- nano, vim, and gedit. Tired of repeating myself, I have created this repository to contain all the config files I use. Instructions for all text editors are specified in the folder README respectively.

Have fun!
